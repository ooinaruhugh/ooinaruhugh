### Hi there! Hallo! Â¡Hola! Merhaba! ðŸ‘‹

> The Ferry Best Mathematician

I'm a PhD student and mathematician at TU Berlin doing Algebraic Statistics. 
Besides that, my interests can be summed up as "if it's with algebraic geometry or computers, I love it".
More specifically:
- I âœ¨*love*âœ¨ algebraic and tropical geometry (did I say that already?), 
- computer graphics (I want to look at geometric stuff after all),
- operating systems programming (not related to the stuff before but also I love to sink time there).
